        <p>
          At Disruptive Capital, we recognize the importance of your privacy and
          the need to ensure transparency regarding how your personal data is
          collected and used. This Cookie Policy is designed to provide you with
          a clear understanding of the role cookies and similar tracking
          technologies play in enhancing your experience on our website. Our
          commitment is to be upfront and clear about the types of cookies we
          use, why we use them, and the choices you have in managing your
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are an essential component of modern websites, enabling smooth
          functionality, personalized interactions, and improved efficiency.
          Whether it's remembering your preferences, helping us analyze website

          we aim to ensure our website remains intuitive, user-friendly, and

        <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device—be it a
          computer, smartphone, or tablet—when you visit a website. These files
          contain bits of information that help websites perform a variety of
          functions, from remembering your login details to providing you with
          personalized content tailored to your preferences. Cookies act as a
          bridge between your browser and the website, enabling seamless
          interaction and enhanced functionality.
        </p>
        <p>There are two main types of cookies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Session Cookies</strong>
            <p>
              These cookies are temporary and exist only for the duration of
              your browsing session. They are automatically deleted from your
              device once you close your browser. Session cookies are commonly
              used to support essential functions, such as navigating between
              pages or ensuring the security of your interactions on a website.
              For example, they may keep you logged in as you browse or prevent
              you from having to re-enter information on every page.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persistent Cookies</strong>
            <p>
              Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies remain on your device
              for a predetermined period or until you manually delete them.
              These cookies are often used to remember your preferences, such as
              language settings or login credentials, so that your experience on
              the website is faster and more convenient during future visits.
              For instance, if you select a preferred currency for an e-commerce
              site, persistent cookies ensure that preference is saved for your
              next visit.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Cookies can also be categorized by the party that places them on your
          device:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>First-Party Cookies:</strong> These are set directly by the
            website you are visiting and are primarily used to enhance
            functionality and performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> These are placed by external
            services or partners, such as analytics providers or advertisers,
            and may be used to track user behavior across different websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to note that cookies are not inherently harmful. They
          do not install programs or carry viruses. Instead, they are tools
          designed to improve the functionality of websites and provide users
          with a more personalized experience. However, because they involve the
          collection of certain data, understanding their purpose and management
          is key to maintaining control over your privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the use of cookies, websites can adapt to your preferences,
          making your online interactions smoother and more efficient. Whether
          it’s enabling secure transactions, speeding up loading times, or
          displaying relevant content, cookies are an integral part of today’s
          digital landscape. At Disruptive Capital, we use cookies responsibly
          to enhance your browsing experience while respecting your privacy and
          choices.

        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          At Disruptive Capital, cookies are an essential part of how we deliver
          a high-quality and personalized experience on our website. These small
          files allow us to ensure that our site operates efficiently, offers
          relevant content, and remains secure for all users. This section
          outlines the specific purposes for which we use cookies and how they
          enhance your browsing experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies play a critical role in ensuring our website works as
          intended. From enabling navigation between pages to remembering your
          preferences and settings, these cookies allow us to provide you with a
          seamless and intuitive user experience. For example, if you customize
          your language settings or save preferences, cookies ensure these
          choices are remembered during your visit and for future interactions.
        </p>
        <h3>Personalized Experiences</h3>
        <p>
          We strive to make your experience on our website as relevant and
          engaging as possible. Functional cookies enable us to tailor content
          to your interests by remembering your past interactions, such as
          visited pages or selected options. This personalization enhances
          usability and ensures that the content you see aligns with your needs
          and expectations.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance and Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding how users interact with our website is crucial to
          improving its design, functionality, and content. Analytics cookies
          help us gather insights into visitor behavior, such as which pages are
          most frequently visited, how long users stay on the site, and what
          features are most used. These cookies allow us to identify areas for
          improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance your overall
          experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Security and Fraud Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies also play an important role in maintaining the security of our
          platform. By identifying potentially malicious activities, such as
          unauthorized access attempts, cookies help safeguard both our systems
          and your data. For instance, authentication cookies ensure that you
          remain logged in securely during a session without the need to
          repeatedly enter your credentials.
        </p>
        <h3>Advertising and Marketing</h3>

          These cookies help us display ads that are tailored to your interests,
          whether on our website or across other platforms. Additionally, they
          enable us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,
          ensuring that we invest in strategies that resonate with our audience.
